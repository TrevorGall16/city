Project Overview: City Sheet
1. Project Type
Curated Travel Directory & Utility Tool.

2. One-Sentence Summary
A high-performance, mobile-first travel encyclopedia that provides curated "cheat sheets" for major cities, featuring a specialized translation tool to bridge language barriers.

3. Core Purpose
The goal is to allow international travelers to immediately find validated local recommendations and communicate them (via native text) to locals so they can navigate foreign environments without language friction.

4. Target Users
Primary: International tourists in cities where they do not speak the local language (e.g., an English speaker in Tokyo).

Intent: Rapidly identifying "Must Eat" or "Must See" items and successfully communicating that desire to a taxi driver or waiter.

5. Core Features
Phase 1: MVP Core Features
Translation Bridge (The Hook) → Click "Copy" icon on item card → Native local text copied to clipboard → User communicates destination/order to locals without speaking.

City Search → Input City Name → Access strict "City Sheet" template → User finds essential logistics and curated lists instantly.

Curated Listings → View "Must Eat" / "Must See" Grids → Visual cards with key info → User trusts high-quality, non-spammy recommendations.

Ad-Supported Layout → Scroll through content → Non-intrusive ad placements → Platform generates revenue without blocking UX.

Phase 2: Social Layer (Not Required for MVP Build)
Social Validation → Auth (Google/Email) + Upvote/Comment → Ranked user tips → User sees most helpful community context first.

6. Constraints and Priorities
Performance Priority: Mobile-First design with Lighthouse Score ≥ 90.

Content Constraint: No user-generated image uploads (Curated images only).

Auth Constraint: Strictly no anonymous commenting or voting; mandatory login via Supabase Auth.

SEO Goal: 100% indexability for all City and Attraction pages via Static Site Generation (SSG).

Monetization Safety: Ad slots must have rigid min-height to prevent Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS).

7. Success Criteria
Performance: Lighthouse Mobile Score ≥ 90; LCP < 2.5s.

SEO: 100% of City and Place pages appear in sitemap.xml and are crawlable.

Engagement: "Copy Local Text" event is successfully tracked in analytics (North Star Metric).

Stability: Zero layout shifts (CLS < 0.03) when ads load.

8. Non-Goals
No user image uploads.

No business-owner dashboards.

No real-time chat.

No paid premium tier (for now).

No AI-generated travel recommendations.

9. Tasks Reserved for Human (Non-AI Work)
Add real curated content for each city (names, descriptions, translations).

Upload real image assets (once available).

Connect your actual ads account.

Verify SEO with real Google indexing tests.

Run Lighthouse on mobile using your real domain.

Replace placeholder icons/images with final assets.

10. Implementation Disclaimer
If any rule creates a contradiction or prevents optimal functionality, refactor the rule and produce the solution that best aligns with the Core Purpose and Success Criteria.
