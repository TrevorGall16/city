The curved shape distinguishes butter croissants from straight margarine ones (a practice starting in the 1980s).",

'Tradition' means it's made by law with only four ingredients (flour, water, salt, yeast) and no additives—superior to regular baguettes. Locals buy them twice daily (morning and evening) because they go stale within hours. The perfect baguette sounds hollow when tapped, cracks when squeezed, and has a wheaty aroma.",

        "history": "Baguettes emerged in the 1920s-1930s in Paris when a law prohibited bakers from working before 4am, forcing them to create fast-baking bread. The 'baguette tradition' was legally defined in 1993 to preserve artisanal methods against industrial bread. It's so iconic that UNESCO recognized French baguette-making as intangible cultural heritage in 2022. Over 10 billion baguettes are consumed in France annually.",

The dough is the same laminated butter dough as croissants, but shaped differently. When pulled apart, the chocolate should be melted and gooey, the dough flaky and buttery.

The name 'pain au chocolat' (chocolate bread) is standard in Paris and most of France. The term 'chocolatine' in Bordeaux/Toulouse creates a north-south cultural divide—Parisians mock it, southerners defend it. The debate is a running joke in French culture.",
        "insider_tip": "Like croissants, buy fresh in the morning from real bakeries, not chains. The chocolate should be dark (at least 60% cocoa), not milk chocolate. Eat it warm—the chocolate melts perfectly. Some bakeries offer variations with almond cream or hazelnut, but purists stick to classic dark chocolate. Pair with café au lait. Never reheat in a microwave—use a toaster oven if stale.",
