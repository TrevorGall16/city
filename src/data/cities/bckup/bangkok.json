Unlike planned cities, it operates as a sprawling, polycentric organism—a collection of disconnected nuclei (historic, commercial, residential) linked by a fragmented transit system. To navigate it effectively in 2025, you must understand its logistical layers: the canal boats that cut through traffic, the 'coupon' economy of food courts, and the invisible social web of 'Kreng Jai' that governs every interaction."
