The locals are 'kind' (they will help you carry a stroller up the stairs) but not 'nice' (they won't smile while doing it). It is a city of layers, where 19th-century history sits directly underneath 21st-century ambition."

            "short": "The Tenement Museum offers guided tours through preserved apartments at 97 Orchard Street (Lower East Side), where 7,000 working-class immigrants lived between 1863-1935. The museum recreates the cramped, difficult living conditions of German, Irish, Jewish, and Italian families. Tours focus on specific families' stories, bringing immigrant history to visceral life. It's deeply moving and historically essential. Advance reservations required.",
            "vibe": "Historic, intimate",
            "history": "97 Orchard Street was built in 1863 as a tenement housing 20 families. It was sealed in 1935 and remained a time capsule until the 1980s when historians discovered it. The museum opened in 1992, restoring apartments to different time periods. It documents the brutal reality of 'Old Law' tenements (windowless rooms, shared toilets).",
            "insider_tip": "Book tours weeks in advance—they sell out. The 'Hard Times' and 'Irish Outsiders' tours are most popular. Tours are 90 minutes and involve stairs (no elevator—it's a real tenement). The museum shop has excellent books on immigration history. Combine with exploring the Lower East Side's food scene (Katz's, Russ & Daughters). Not suitable for young children.",

The wooden pedestrian path sits above traffic. Arrive in DUMBO (Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass) and snap the famous photo of the Empire State Building framed by the bridge.

The park is 843 acres of designed nature in the middle of Manhattan. On weekends, you'll see musicians, dancers, and artists performing. This manufactured wilderness somehow feels essential.",
