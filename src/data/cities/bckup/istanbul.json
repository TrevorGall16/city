            "short": "The Princes' Islands are an archipelago of nine islands in the Sea of Marmara, accessible by ferry from Istanbul. The four largest (Büyükada, Heybeliada, Burgazada, Kınalıada) are car-free, relying on bicycles, electric vehicles, and walking. They offer a tranquil escape with Victorian mansions, pine forests, swimming spots, and fish restaurants. Büyükada is the largest and most visited.",
            "vibe": "Tranquil, Nostalgic, Car-free",
            "history": "The islands served as a place of exile for Byzantine royalty—hence 'Princes' Islands.' During the Ottoman era, they became home to Greek, Armenian, and Jewish communities seeking escape from the city. In the 19th-20th centuries, wealthy Istanbulites built wooden mansions as summer retreats. Leon Trotsky lived in exile on Büyükada from 1929-1933, writing 'The History of the Russian Revolution' there. After the 1950s, the islands declined as wealthy families left, but they've become popular day-trip destinations.",
            "insider_tip": "Take the ferry to Büyükada (largest island) early in the day—ferries get packed on summer weekends. Rent a bike immediately upon arrival to explore before crowds arrive. Avoid the touristy horse carriages (phaeton)—animal welfare is questionable. Swim at Yörükali Beach or Halik Koyu. Have lunch at waterfront fish restaurants on the backside of the island, not the ferry dock area.",

            "short": "Balat is a historic neighborhood on the Golden Horn, once home to Istanbul's Jewish and Greek communities. Its colorful, crumbling Ottoman houses cascading down narrow streets became Instagram-famous in the 2010s. The area is rapidly gentrifying, with hip cafes and vintage shops replacing traditional workshops. It's photogenic and atmospheric, though increasingly self-aware of its tourist appeal.",
            "vibe": "Colorful, Gentrifying, Instagrammable",
            "history": "After the 1492 Spanish Inquisition, Sultan Bayezid II invited expelled Sephardic Jews to settle in Balat, which became Istanbul's primary Jewish quarter. Greek Orthodox communities also lived here for centuries. The Ahrida Synagogue (15th century) still stands. In the 20th century, as minorities emigrated, the neighborhood fell into poverty and neglect. In the 2000s-2010s, UNESCO restoration projects and Instagram culture transformed it into a tourist hotspot, pricing out remaining locals.",
            "insider_tip": "Go early morning (8-9 AM) to see the neighborhood before Instagram photographers descend. The most photogenic street is Kiremit Caddesi with its rainbow-colored houses. Beyond the tourist façade, explore side streets to find authentic workshops, Greek tavernas, and local markets. Visit the Fener Greek Orthodox Patriarchate and Ahrida Synagogue (call ahead). Avoid weekends when it's overrun.",

The early light through its massive dome is ethereal. Few tourists at this hour means you can actually feel the weight of Byzantine and Ottoman history.",
