      "Beach Culture is King: Cariocas (Rio locals) live on the beach. It's not just for tourists—it's their living room, gym, and social club. Each beach has different tribes (postos) with distinct vibes.",
      "Cheek Kiss Greeting: Two cheek kisses (beijinhos) are standard, even with strangers in social settings. Start on the right. Men often hug or handshake other men but kiss women.",
      "Cashless Beach: Don't bring valuables. Beach vendors accept cards now, but keep cash minimal. Use waterproof pouches for phones.",
      "The '10%' Service Charge: Called 'taxa de serviço' and usually included in restaurant bills. It's not mandatory but refusing it is socially awkward. Check if it's already added.",
      "Late Dining: Dinner starts at 9pm or later. Lunch is the big meal (12-2pm). Eating dinner at 6pm marks you as a tourist.",
      "Football is Religion: Never disparage someone's football team. The rivalry between Flamengo, Fluminense, Botafogo, and Vasco is serious. Wearing rival colors in certain neighborhoods can cause problems.",
      "Samba Respect: If you're at a roda de samba (samba circle), don't talk during performances. Clap and sing along if you know the words, but never interrupt the musicians.",
      "Safety Awareness: Don't flash expensive jewelry, phones, or cameras. Use ride apps instead of hailing taxis. Avoid empty beaches at night. Trust your instincts.",
      "Sunga Culture: Brazilian men wear speedos (sungas) at the beach. Board shorts are for tourists. Women wear minimal bikinis (fio dental - dental floss). No one judges.",
