      "The Tray Return Rule: It is legally mandatory to return your used trays and crockery at hawker centers and food courts. First-time offenders get a warning, but repeat offenders face a $300 fine. Keep it clean!",
      "Halal vs Non-Halal: Always check the signs at tray return stations. Mixing non-halal plates into a halal station is culturally insensitive and a big no-no.",
      "The 'Choping' Ritual: If you see a packet of tissue paper on an empty table at a hawker center, that table is reserved! Respect this local system to avoid social friction.",
      "Escalator Discipline: Stand on the LEFT, walk on the RIGHT. This is a strictly observed rule in MRT stations and malls. Don't be the person blocking the fast lane!",
      "No Chewing Gum: The sale and import of chewing gum is banned. While having some for personal use isn't strictly illegal, spitting it out is a major offense. Best to leave it at home.",
      "Tipping Reality: Tipping is not customary. Most restaurants add a 10% service charge and 9% GST automatically. At hawker stalls, tipping is non-existent and might just confuse the uncle or auntie.",
      "Indoor Winter: Singapore loves air conditioning! While it's 30°C outside, malls and cinemas are often kept at a freezing 20°C. Always carry a light cardigan or shawl.",
      "Water is Safe: You can drink straight from the tap here! The water is strictly treated and perfectly safe, so save your money and the environment by skipping bottled water.",
      "Queue Culture: Singaporeans love a good queue. Whether it's for the latest gadget or a famous chicken rice stall, always join the back and wait your turn patiently.",
      "Mind Your Singlish: You'll hear plenty of 'Lah', 'Leh', and 'Lor'. It's a unique local creole. While you don't need to speak it, understanding that it's about efficiency rather than slang will help you navigate better."
