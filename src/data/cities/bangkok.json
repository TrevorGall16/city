Unlike planned cities, it operates as a sprawling, polycentric organismâ€”a collection of disconnected nuclei (historic, commercial, residential) linked by a fragmented transit system. To navigate it effectively in 2025, you must understand its logistical layers: the canal boats that cut through traffic, the 'coupon' economy of food courts, and the invisible social web of 'Kreng Jai' that governs every interaction."

      "Cooling Powder: A local survival hack. Mentholated talc (Snake Brand) applied after a shower provides a chemical cooling sensation. Essential for surviving April heat.",

      "Jai Yen (Cool Heart): Getting angry in public makes you 'lose face'. No matter how frustrated you are (traffic, scams), maintain a calm smile. It is a tactical necessity.",

      "Respect the Monarchy: Never disrespect the King or Royal Family. It is illegal and deeply offensive (Lese Majeste).",

      "Don't Touch Heads: The head is sacred. Never touch anyone's head, including children.",

      "Remove Shoes: Take off shoes before entering temples, homes, and some shops.",

      "Cannabis Reality (2025): Public consumption is illegal and fined. Smoking is restricted to private residences or dispensary designated areas. The 'Wild West' era is over.",

      "Spice is Serious: 'Medium' spice is very hot. Order 'Mai Phet' (no spice) or 'Phet Nit Noi' (little spice) to be safe.",

      "Street Food and Water: Do not drink tap water. Stick to bottled water.",

      "Cash is King: Street vendors and taxis rarely take cards. Keep small bills (20s, 50s, 100s) handy.",
