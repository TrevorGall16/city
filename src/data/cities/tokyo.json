      "The 'Meiwaku' Rule: The golden rule of Tokyo is 'Meiwaku'—avoiding nuisance to others. This explains why trains are silent and backpacks are worn on the front. It is not just politeness; it is infrastructure.",
      "Silence is Social Glue: Noise creates social friction. Talking on the phone on the train is a major taboo. Conversations should be hushed. Silence is an active behavior to respect shared space.",
      "The Trash Reality: There are NO public trash cans (a legacy of 1995 security measures). You must carry your trash with you until you find a bin at a convenience store (konbini) or your hotel.",
      "Tabearuki (No Eating While Walking): Walking while eating is frowned upon ('sloppy'). If you buy street food, stand near the shop to eat it, dispose of trash there, and then move on.",
      "Queue Culture: Lining up is sacred. Whether it's for the train or a restaurant, never cut the line. If there's a queue, the food is probably worth it.",
      "Cash vs Card: While modernizing, many Ramen shops, ticket machines, and temples are still CASH ONLY. Always carry 10,000 Yen in cash.",
      "Escalator Sides: Stand on the LEFT, walk on the RIGHT. This is rigidly enforced by peer pressure. (Note: This swaps in Osaka).",
      "Procedural Politeness: Japanese politeness is about correctness and efficiency, not emotional warmth. A lack of smiles doesn't mean they are rude; it means they are focused on doing their job perfectly.",
      "No Tipping: Excellent service is standard. Tipping causes confusion and may be returned to you as 'lost money'.",
      "Shoes Off: Look for the entryway step (genkan). If there are slippers, use them. Never wear toilet slippers outside the bathroom."
