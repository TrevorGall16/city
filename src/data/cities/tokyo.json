      "The Trash Reality: There are NO public trash cans. You must carry your trash with you until you find a bin at a convenience store (konbini) or your hotel. Eat where you buy—don't walk and eat.",
      "Queue Culture: Lining up is sacred. Whether it's for the train or a restaurant, never cut the line. If there's a queue, the food is probably worth it.",
      "Cash vs Card: While modernizing, many Ramen shops, ticket machines, and temples are still CASH ONLY. Always carry 10,000 Yen in cash.",

      "No Tipping: Excellent service is standard. Tipping causes confusion and may be returned to you as 'lost money'.",
      "Shoes Off: Look for the entryway step. If there are slippers, use them. Never wear toilet slippers outside the bathroom."
