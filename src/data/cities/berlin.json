      "Rules are Sacred: You wait for the green light (Ampelmann), even at 3am on an empty street. Jaywalking is socially judged. Rules are the social contract that holds the chaos together.",
      "Sunday Reality: Sunday is for 'Ruhe' (rest). Shops, supermarkets, and pharmacies are closed. No drilling, no loud music, no glass recycling. The city shuts down.",
      "The Späti Culture: The 'Späti' (late-night corner store) is the center of social life. Grab a beer (€1.50) and sit on the bench outside. It is the Berlin way.",
      "Club Protocol: No photos. Ever. Sticker your camera. Dress casually (black helps), know the DJ, and don't be drunk in line. The queue is serious business; cutting will get you banned.",
      "Ticket Validation: There are no turnstiles, but plainclothes inspectors are ruthless. You MUST stamp your ticket in the little machine before boarding. Fine is €60.",
      "Pfand System: Don't crush cans/bottles. They are worth €0.25. Leave them next to bins for collectors if you don't return them yourself."
