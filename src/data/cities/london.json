It is a leading global city in arts, commerce, education, entertainment, fashion, finance, healthcare, media, professional services, research and development, tourism, and transportation. But beyond the monuments, it operates as a federation of distinct 'villages'—from the polished streets of Marylebone to the gritty creativity of Shoreditch—fused by history and the Tube."
