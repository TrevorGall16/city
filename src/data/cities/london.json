It is a leading global city in arts, commerce, education, entertainment, fashion, finance, healthcare, media, professional services, research and development, tourism, and transportation. But beyond the monuments, it operates as a federation of distinct 'villages'—from the polished streets of Marylebone to the gritty creativity of Shoreditch—fused by history and the Tube."

      "Tube Silence: On the Underground, silence is golden. Do not talk loudly, play music, or make prolonged eye contact. It is a private space in public.",

      "Queueing is Sacred: Never cut in line. The queue is a British institution and jumping it is social suicide. If unsure, ask 'Who is last?'.",
